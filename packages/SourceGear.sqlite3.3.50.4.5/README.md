This package contains builds of SQLite for various platforms.  

These builds have "e_sqlite3" as the base name.  The first three numbers in the version number of this package indicate the version of SQLite that was used to build it.  The fourth number, if there is one, is incremented as needed for packaging-specific changes.

There may be a delay between a given SQLite release and the posting of this package publicly on nuget.org.  On the SourceGear SQLite Build Service, this package is updated immediately after each SQLite release.  More information about the SQLite-related services offered by SourceGear is available at: [https://sqlite.sourcegear.com/](https://sqlite.sourcegear.com/)
